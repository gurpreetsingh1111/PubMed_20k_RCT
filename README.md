In this project, we're going to be putting what we've learned into practice.

More specificially, we're going to be replicating the deep learning model behind the 2017 paper PubMed 200k RCT: https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.06071

When it was released, the paper presented a new dataset called PubMed 200k RCT which consists of ~200,000 labelled Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) abstracts.

The goal of the dataset was to explore the ability for NLP models to classify sentences which appear in sequential order.

In other words, given the abstract of a RCT, what role does each sentence serve in the abstract?
